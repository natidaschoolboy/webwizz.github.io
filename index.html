                <h2>Overview of the<br><span>World</span> Wide <span>Web</span></h2>
                <p>Invented by Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web is a system of interconnected computer networks that make up the internet. Another available definition claims that the World Wide Web is a system of interconnected webpages and documents that you can access through the internet. Some may like to think of it as a giant online library where videos, documents, and pictures can be found. To access the World Wide Web, one would need to connect to the internet and access it through a web browser.
                    <br>As the World Wide Web is a vast collection of webpages, a URL is required to easily and accurately navigate to the desired webpage. This navigation is done over protocols, namely the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), which is used to send and receive web pages. HTTPS (HTTP Secure) provides extra security to keep the environment user-friendly on a secure platform for the exchange of information.
                    <br>All in all, the World Wide Web is a platform that allows people all over the world to connect to one another and access resources from anywhere at any time.</p>

                    <p>This happened in October 1969 where as part of the ARPANET network test a message was sent over the internet.
                         Two computers were connected using a 4.5m long cable on an interface known as the IMP (Interface Message Processor) which was the first ever router.
                         The message that was sent was "LOGIN" and the response was "WELCOME".</p>

                    <p>In October 29, 1971, Ray Tomilson who was working on a computer network called CPYNET
                         sent an email between two computers that were located next to each other.
                         The "@" symbol came up as a way to separate the sender's name from the computer's name.

                    <p>In December 1983, the TCP/IP was adopted by the Internet
                         Engineering Task Force as the standard communication protocol for the internet. The TCP/IP protocol was developed originally in the 1970s and was already being utilised by many agencies and government organisations and was officially
                         recognised and adopted in 1983 which sparked a rapid growth and expansion of the network that followed.

                         for scientists around the world to share information between each other he came up with the idea of a Hypertext system which allowed
                         users to access documents from any computer on the network.</p>

                <p>In the early years of the internet’s existence (1960s-1970s), it was primarily used as a research tool by scientists and engineers, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense. It was a closed network and only a small number of people had access to it. The commercialization of the internet started (1980s-1990s) where the Internet was opened up to the public and commercial applications were developed, such as email and the World Wide Web. After the development of the World Wide Web, the internet evolved more. There was a rapid increase in the number of people using the Internet as the World Wide Web made the Internet more accessible to the general public. The growth of e-commerce sites, such as Amazon and eBay, led to a major shift in how people shop and buy goods. The rise of social media sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, changed the way people interact with each other and the way information is shared.</p>
